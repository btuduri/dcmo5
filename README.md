dcmo5
=====

This is a version of DCMO5 with some changes for an emulation closer to the real hardware.
 * Uses the MO5 color palette, not the TO7/70 one.

Unfortunately, Daniel decided to develop DCMOTO as a Windows-only and closed source emulator, leaving users of other operating systems without update for a few years. This is an attempt to improve the situation for people not using windows and wanting to run Thomson games anyway.
